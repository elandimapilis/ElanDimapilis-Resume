        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Elan Dimapilis and I am an 18 year old first year student at University of California Riverside. I was raised by separated parents which made life very difficult and complicated growing up. My parents weren't always there to guide me or make sure I was doing well in school. However, I knew the importance of school and took it upon myself to accomplish my goals. In order to give a better life to my family that comes after me I knew that only I could make a difference in both my life and theirs. I am a hardworking and motivated college student with aspirations to ultimately make a positive impact on the world. I take pride in my education and am motivated by the chance to change the lives of others. My passion is found in selflessly helping and working with others. Communication is essential in every aspect of life and I find that through my experiences I have become efficient in relaying information to others. Punctuality is highly important to me as I keep a schedule and a list of tasks I need to complete.<br><br>

        Through high school I maintained exceptional grades and took part in assisting the community through a long term volunteer service at Torrance Memorial Medical Center. While taking difficult classes and volunteering weekly, I balanced my time by sticking to a planned schedule and by staying focused on what needed to be done. I take pride in assisting families and patients by communicating and helping them with their needs. Whether it is discharging patients of surgery or simply delivering flowers or letters to their room. Through volunteering I was able to interact with a wide variety of individuals in my community as well as medical professionals in their working environment. I gained insight into job opportunities that may lay ahead of me in addition to my experience in assisting others with tasks big or small. I was also exposed to leadership opportunities by training incoming volunteers and leading by example. <br><br>

        Although my study habits were terrible in high school, I recognized the increased difficulty coming into college. I transitioned well by creating a strict schedule in which I focused solely on school. During this time I emphasized the importance of fully making the attempt to understand and digest information. It is also important to have a balance. I made this possible by allowing myself time in the day to enjoy hobbies of mine. Ultimately, my focus on education and pursuing a successful career is a top priority. In order to reach the goals and accomplishments I have set for myself I know that I must focus on things I can change and improve on. I want to give my future children a life I never had and I want to enjoy things in life that I want. I am at my best when I find the motivation to accomplish a goal. Luckily for me I have always been motivated to give myself a better and more comfortable life.
